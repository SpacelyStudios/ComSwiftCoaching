       <p> As an Educator, Coach and Trainer, my focus is your professional and personal growth with an emphasis on wealth building. My life was changed when I began my career with Keller Williams Farmington Hills, MI in January 2006. I was working with Real Estate One as their Corporate Coach and Trainer, where I was responsible for writing and facilitating training programs for all of their associates at all levels of productivity when I received a call that would change my life!</p>
