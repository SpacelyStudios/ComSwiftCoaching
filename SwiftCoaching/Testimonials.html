                <td>Sherry Swift is an outstanding coach.  My production has doubled while in her coaching program, and I am averaging additional 1-2 listings a month since I started with Sherry.  I am certain that an accountability/ production coach is one of the main keys to a consistent and effective business.  The tools that I have been given and the resources I now have, are integrated into my business and have become a part of my every day.  I have created new habits and a new mindset that is propelling my business forward and will go further than I had once imagined. - Cindi Kozlowski </td>

                <td>I joined Keller Williams in late June and as soon as it was available I plugged into Sherry’s coaching seminars. She has a wealth of knowledge to share with everyone.  I feel I have catapulted years ahead with all the ideas and resources that have been shared by Sherry and Keller Williams.  It isn’t easy but the time spent is well worth it. One of the greatest things is having someone to go to with questions and ideas who is available to listen and help. The different classes I’ve attended have helped me focus on what is important to get my business up and running and profitable.  They have forced me to think out of the box and get myself organized.  It has taught me that I have a team of knowledgeable professionals available to help with the different scenarios that come up today in Real Estate. I would encourage anyone who has been in the business a longtime or just a short time, like me, to plug into the coaching Resources available with Sherry and our Great Team.¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬ – Sheila Roma </td>

                <td>Working with Sherry Swift has changed my career and my life! Progressive principals and techniques coupled with one on one personalized coaching, action plans and accountability, Sherry's coaching program offers every Real Estate an opportunity to take their business to the next level, in their own unique style. Sherry's years of experience are generously given to each Agent to motivate, encourage and stretch their skills to the highest level possible! I have experienced this for myself and have had the privilege to see this progression in others. Sherry lives to inspires, selflessly drives her Agents to push thru their individual barriers and then celebrates each accomplishment ... you'll never look at your business the same!  </td>

                <td>I am a newer agent at KW and new to the industry since August 1, 2011.  I must say it has been a fulfilling experience although challenging as well.  I am learning so much about business not just selling homes.  I am becoming a business owner and not just a sales person.  The coaching program has been a success in my life because of the knowledge, structure, and accountability that Sherry has brought to the table for my business.  Every agent has their own needs and desires on where they want their business to go from start to finish.  Sherry and the coaching program have a system in place for all of those needs to make each business plan come into fruition.  I was a bit skeptical in the beginning because I wasn't sure if I would be able to keep up. Not only am I keeping up with the program, I have watched my business grow quickly since I have been in the coaching program.  I can truly say that I am grateful that I partnered with KW because the institution of the coaching program is definitely key in helping to motivate agents into success and I am very thankful for it. –Clifford Lee Jr. </td>

                <td>Sherry Swift and the KW Novi office have provided me with an opportunity that is unheard of in our industry. Sherry’s experience as a coach and her diverse background in Real Estate has been helpful to me in many ways. When Sherry teaches she stays focused and by doing so she keeps the group focused. Whether in a group setting or one to one she does not stray from the task at hand. She is never judgmental but always probes for the real reason that a person may be having difficulty with some aspect of their business. It has been my experience in dealing with Sherry that she is not tied to one method to achieve an outcome. Sherry realizes that everyone is different in their ability and their strengths and we each have our own production goal. Sherry helps me to understand what I need to do in my own way to achieve what I want. Sherry incorporates the Keller Williams business planning and tracking tools to help an agent plan, track, and grow their business. Sherry is hands on when it comes to using these tools. She does not say “here, use this” but rather “here, let us see how this can help you”. In this and many other ways she is an asset to our office 
Real Estate is an ever changing business and one needs to be prepared to change along with it. Sherry Swift can help you. She has helped me.

                <td>After 16 years of being an Account Manager involved with engineering sales, I feel so incredibly lucky to have launched into the world of real estate the right way with Sherry.
Sherry has been key in providing the support and techniques necessary to change one's mindset from worker bee to self motivated, accountable, efficient and highly successful business owner. Sherry provides so much information, I feel that I can build up my new business in a way that is completely personal and works for me. She has given me vision and allowed me to dream bigger. I strongly feel that having someone like Sherry to rely on for coaching and motivation, while starting a new career, can mean the difference between failure and great success.
Thanks Sherry!
